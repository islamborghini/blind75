# Solution for 1. Two Sum
## Solution using hashmaps: 
<p>For every element in an array do the following: <br>
If the element is not in a hashmap, add it to a hashmap with the key target - num <br>
If the element is in a hashmap, we can return the index of this element and the index of target - num from the hashmap we have.
</p>
<p>Time complexity: O(n)</p>
<p>Space complexity: O(n)</p>
